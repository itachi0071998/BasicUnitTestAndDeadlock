This is a basic project for learning TDD(test driven development) 
I have build a simple shopping application and written there unit tests using TDD approach. In this project I first wrote the unit tests then I developed actual methods.
By writing unit tests first it gave me a idea as in how the function should work.

Apart from this I have added two classes in deadlock package one is where actually deadlock is present and in second one is how to prevent it from happening.
